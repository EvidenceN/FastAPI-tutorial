*This is where you would normally add your notebook files if you want to host your notebook file in the same file system. You could totally have your notebook somewhere else and then just pickle your model. Then use your pickled model for the API without having your notebook in this APP. Your notebook might be several megabits or even gigabits of data, so to keep this app lightweight, you may want to host it somewhere else and just use pickled model here*
